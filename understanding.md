<h2 align="center">OBJECTIVE</h2> 

 <p align="center"> To write a test script which can test our script.sh against different test cases and tell how much reliable is our script.sh </p>
 
 <h2 align="center">OVERVIEW OF SCRIPT.SH</h2> 
<p>We are downloading two google spreadsheet in csv format and then manipulating the downloaded csv to get the output in below format.
<br>
Name: abc<br>
Avg: aa <br>
Sum: bb
</p>

<h2 align="center">UNDERSTANDING</h2>
<p align=center> We have given a new task to create a new script which is testing the previous script according to different test cases, whether it pass or fail as per assessment. So that we can know how much reliable is our script.</p>
  
<!--   |Sr No.|Test Cases|Condition|
   |:----:|:----:|:----:|
   |1|To check if the link is properly typed and is working or not| Pass or Fail|
   |2|To check if the two downloaded files are in CSV format or not| Pass or Fail|
   |3|If the generated output is name, avg and sum is exact or not|Pass or fail|
   |4|If adding the Extra columns or rows will make the script to run and generate desired output|Pass or Fail|
   |5|If Config file is linked to the Script and logs are generated for the script|Pass or Fail|

<h1 align="center"> TEST CASES </h1>


|  Test Case ID |   Test Scenario |   Test Description|  Expected Results |  Actual Results | Pass/Fail  |
| :------------: | :------------: | :------------: | :------------: | :------------: | :------------: |
|`TC01` | Comparing exact without changes| Comparing outputs of both the file without any changes in the spreadsheet| Same output of both the file  | Same output  |  Pass |
|`TC02`|  Adding Column | Comparing output generated by our testscript   | Same output of both the file | Same output  |  Pass |
|`TC03`|  Deleting Column |  Comparing output after deleting column | Same output of both the file  | Same output  | Pass  |
|`TC04` | Adding Row  |  Comparing output after adding a row | Same output of both the file | Same output  |  Pass |
|`TC05` | Deleting Row  | Comparing output after deleting a row  | Same output of both the file  | Same output  | Pass  |


### Conclusion 
We have successfully compared the output in different scenarios of script.sh with our testscript.sh
